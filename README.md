# Tetris
A tetris game using slick2d library for my second semester university project.

Slick2D: http://slick.ninjacave.com/

Setup:

1. Open eclipse/netbeans/intellij/*whatever* and import code as a new project.
2. Link libraries in lib folder to project build path.
3. Configure VM options to include native lwjgl libraries: <br>
    ``-Djava.library.path=<lwjgl-X.X lib/natives-windows``
    
Read slick2d wiki first if something is not clear.
